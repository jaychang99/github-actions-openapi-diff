# Start Development Server

- To start developing, two processes must be running in parallel

```bash
npm install
npm run package:watch:local # This compiles ts files and watches for changes
npm run dev:nodemon # This starts a local development server on localhost:5050
```

- In local development environment, source code is configured to get...
  - base branch's openapi info from `.local/examples/openapi-base.json`
  - HEAD's openapi info from `.local/examples/openapi-head.json`
- Make a directory as follows and add `openapi-base.json`, `openapi-head.json`
  of your choice for development.
  - These files MUST be openapi **V3-compatible**.

```
(project root)...
.local
  examples
    openapi-base.json
    openapi-head.json
...
```

- Go to http://localhost:5050 on your browser and start developing.
